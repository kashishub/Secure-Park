# 🚗 SecurePark ID – Vehicle Contact System

SecurePark ID is a web-based Vehicle Contact System that allows vehicle owners to generate a QR code sticker for their vehicle. 

In case of emergency, blocking, or parking issues, anyone can scan the QR code and directly contact the vehicle owner via Call, WhatsApp, or SMS — without publicly displaying the owner's number on the vehicle.

## 📌 Problem Statement

Many vehicles get blocked in parking areas, residential complexes, or public spaces. Displaying phone numbers publicly is unsafe and compromises privacy.

SecurePark ID solves this by:
- Generating a QR-based contact system
- Protecting the owner's number from being visibly displayed
- Allowing controlled communication when needed
